# AI Stenographer

**AI Stenographer** is a free, offline, real-time speech recognition desktop application designed for work and personal use. It converts spoken words into text in real time, without an internet connection and without sending any data anywhere.

The Stenographer is good to create logs of meetings and conversations.

It can work in the background on a modern notebook, consuming 0.5% of CPU, just in case you want to recall what you talked about.

It allows entering text with voice to any other application.
